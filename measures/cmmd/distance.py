    This implements the minimum-variance/biased version of the estimator described
    in Eq.(5) of
    https://jmlr.csail.mit.edu/papers/volume13/gretton12a/gretton12a.pdf.
    As described in Lemma 6's proof in that paper, the unbiased estimate and the
    minimum-variance estimate for MMD are almost identical.

    Note that the first invocation of this function will be considerably slow due
    to JAX JIT compilation.

    Args:
      x: The first set of embeddings of shape (n, embedding_dim).
      y: The second set of embeddings of shape (n, embedding_dim).

    Returns:
      The MMD distance between x and y embedding sets.
